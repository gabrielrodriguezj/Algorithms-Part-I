# Algorithms Part I

## Week 1: Percolations
Program that estimates the value of the percolation threshold through the Monte Carlo simulation. A problem solver with dynamically connectivity.

## Week 2: Queues
Program that implements two data structure:
* Double-ended queue or deque (pronounced "deck"), which is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure.
* Randomized queue, which is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random from items in the data structure.

## Week 3: Collinear Points
Given a set of n distinct points in the plane, find every (maximal) line segment that connects a subset of 4 or more of the points.

## Note
The file algs4.jar is needed for run the code, thats the reason why is in the repository.
